That’s a great instinct—understanding camera “lore” can help fine-tune prompts for even more cinematic and authentic results. Here’s a quick guide to boost your image prompts:

### 📸 **Camera Lore to Use in Prompts**

1. **Camera Body + Lens**

   * *Leica M6 + 50mm* (like you used): Classic film look, shallow depth of field, rich colors.
   * *Canon AE-1 + 35mm*: Vintage, street-style, more scene in frame.
   * *Hasselblad 500CM + 80mm*: Medium format film, extremely sharp, square frame, often used in portraits.
   * *Sony A7R IV + 85mm f/1.4*: Modern digital, ultra-detailed, creamy bokeh for portraits.

2. **Lens Style**

   * *50mm*: Natural perspective, classic portrait lens.
   * *35mm*: Wider angle, great for environmental portraits and storytelling.
   * *85mm or 135mm*: Flattering for headshots, very shallow depth of field.
   * *Wide Aperture (f/1.4 – f/2.0)*: Great for dreamy, soft backgrounds.

3. **Film Stock**

   * *Kodak Portra 400*: Warm tones, great skin, cinematic.
   * *Fujifilm Superia*: Cooler, punchy colors, high contrast.
   * *Ilford HP5 (B\&W)*: Moody black and white, good for emotional impact.

4. **Lighting Terms**

   * *Natural light*: Soft and realistic.
   * *Backlit*: Sun or light source behind subject—creates halo/glow.
   * *Golden hour*: Warm light right after sunrise or before sunset.
   * *Soft light / diffused light*: No harsh shadows, like on a cloudy day.

5. **Depth of Field**

   * *Shallow DoF (f/1.4 – f/2.8)*: Subject sharp, background blurred. Great for emotional focus.
   * *Deep DoF (f/8 – f/16)*: Everything in focus—ideal for landscapes or interiors.

6. **Styling & Vibes**

   * *Cinematic / analog-style*: Use with “shot on 35mm film,” “natural grain,” “muted tones.”
   * *Documentary look*: Use “candid moment,” “available light,” “photojournalism style.”
   * *Editorial*: Use “posed,” “studio lighting,” “high-end magazine aesthetic.”
