Great lighting prompts can dramatically influence the mood and realism of your images. Here are some effective ones categorized by type:

### ðŸŒ… **Natural Light**

* *Golden hour light* â€“ "bathed in warm golden hour sunlight with long soft shadows"
* *Dappled sunlight* â€“ "sunlight filtering through trees, casting dappled patterns on the subject"
* *Overcast light* â€“ "soft, diffuse light from an overcast sky, no harsh shadows"

### ðŸ’¡ **Artificial Light**

* *Neon glow* â€“ "illuminated by vibrant neon lights in pink and blue, creating a cyberpunk ambiance"
* *Studio lighting* â€“ "even, controlled lighting with a white backdrop, professional studio setup"
* *Spotlight effect* â€“ "subject dramatically lit by a single overhead spotlight, with dark shadows"

### ðŸŒƒ **Mood Lighting**

* *Candlelight* â€“ "flickering candlelight casting warm, low light and soft shadows"
* *Moonlight* â€“ "cool blue moonlight illuminating the scene with ethereal tones"
* *Backlit* â€“ "strong backlight casting the subject in silhouette with a glowing rim"

### ðŸ“¸ **Photography Inspired**

* *Bokeh lighting* â€“ "sharp subject with background lights blurred into soft bokeh"
* *High contrast lighting* â€“ "strong highlights and deep shadows, dramatic chiaroscuro effect"
* *Rembrandt lighting* â€“ "classic portrait lighting with triangle of light under the eye"

Would you like me to create sample images using one of these lighting styles?
