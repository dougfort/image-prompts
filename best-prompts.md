# Best Prompts

##

To generate **realistic images** using ChatGPT (specifically with DALL·E via GPT-4o), your prompts need to be detailed, grounded in physical plausibility, and describe photographic elements explicitly. Here’s how to write the most effective prompts, followed by some strong templates:

### 🧠 **General Guidelines for Realism**

| Strategy                                | Description                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Photographic Language**           | Specify lens types (e.g., "85 mm portrait"), depth of field, lighting conditions, and framing.                             |
| **Describe Physical Details**           | Include texture, material, color, posture, expression, setting, time of day.                                              |
| **Reference Real-World Styles**         | Mention camera brands ("DSLR", "Leica"), film stock, or real art movements ("realistic oil painting", "photojournalism"). |
| **Avoid Overly Abstract/Surreal Terms** | For realism, avoid “floating cities” or “crystal skin” unless grounded in plausible detail.                               |
| **Anchor in Reality**                   | Use locations, known object types, time periods, or social context.                                                       |

### ✅ **Examples of Well-Tuned Prompts**

#### 📸 **People**

* *“A photorealistic image of a 10-year-old boy with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a 1960s British school uniform: blazer, shorts, knee socks. He’s standing on a cobbled street in overcast morning light, holding a leather satchel. Captured with a Leica M6, 50 mm lens, shallow depth of field.”*

#### 🐾 **Animals**

* *“A realistic photo of a young golden retriever sitting in a sunlit backyard. The dog's fur is golden and slightly curly, with backlighting creating a halo effect. Shot with a Canon EOS 5D at golden hour, soft shadows on green grass.”*

#### 🏙️ **Architecture / Urban**

* *“A photorealistic image of a 1930s Parisian street corner in black and white. Cobblestones glisten with rain, and a man in a trench coat walks under a lamppost. The buildings have wrought-iron balconies, and the atmosphere is cinematic. Taken with a Rolleiflex 3.5F.”*

#### 🧍‍♂️ **Portraits**

* *“Studio portrait of a middle-aged Japanese man in traditional hakama, neutral expression, front-lit with a softbox, plain gray background. Shot at f/1.8 for slight blur on shoulders.”*

### ⚠️ **Avoid These Common Mistakes**

| Mistake                                          | Fix                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| “Ultra-realistic cyborg fairy with dragon wings” | If realism is key, ground it: “A woman in cyberpunk cosplay, Tokyo alley, evening rain.”   |
| Vague terms like “beautiful” or “cool”           | Replace with concrete descriptions: “soft golden hour light,” “matte black leather jacket” |
| No context                                       | Always describe *setting*, *light*, and *focus*.                                           |

### 🧪 Advanced Tips

* Use **photographer names** for style: “in the style of Steve McCurry,” “like a National Geographic wildlife shot”
* Specify **lighting types**: “Rembrandt lighting,” “backlit by sunset,” “fluorescent interior light”
* Use **camera settings** if appropriate: “shot at ISO 400, f/2.8, 1/125s”
